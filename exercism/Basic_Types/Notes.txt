Chapter 7 — Basic Types (from C Programming: A Modern Approach)

1. What are Basic Types in C

In C, every variable has a type, which decides:
	how much memory it uses,
	and what kind of data it stores.

The main types:
	int			2 or 4 bytes
	float			4 bytes
	double		8 bytes
	char			1 byte
	bool			1 byte
	void			--------
	NOTE:	1 octet = 1 Byte
				("%zu", sizeof(int)) Tells you how many bytes a type uses
	
Type modifiers:
	You can modify integer types
	short			smaller int
	long				larger int
	unsigned		only positive numbers
	
Constants and Suffixes:
	C understands number endings (suffixes)
	123U			unsigned int
	123L			long
	3.14F			float
	3.14				double (default)
	
Character and ASCII:
	char holds one symbol, but really stores a number (ASCII code).
	Example:		char c = 'A'		// value = 65
	
Overflow and precision:
	Each type has a limit.
	Example:		char c = 130		 // overflow! (max 127 = 1byte)
	it wraps around (becomes negative)
	
Type conversion (typecasting):
	Convert one type to another
	int x = 5,	 y = 2
	float result = (float)x / y		 // 2.5 not 2 (At least one end must be float, x or y)
	
Enumerations (enum):
	Let you create your own list of constants
	enum Day { MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI };
		now: MON = 0	TUE = 1	WED = 2	...
	enum Day today = WED;		// replace int today = 2;
	
	I can change the values par default
	enum Level { LOW = 1, MEDIUM = 5, HIGH = 10 };
	
	NOTE:	enum Test { A = 10, B, C = 20, D };
				// output: A = 10		B = A + 1		C = 20		D = 21
	
	Where do I need enum?
		- menu choices
		- states (ready, loading, error…)
		- difficulty levels
		- days / months
		- modes (ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE)
		- help you in switch
		Example:
			enum State { LOADING, READY, ERROR };
			enum Drink { ESPRESSO = 1, LATTE = 2, TEA = 3 };
