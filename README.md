C Learning – Structured Roadmap
---

This repository contains my organized learning path for the C programming language.
Each main folder focuses on a specific core area of C, with examples, exercises, and small applied projects.

📁 Structure Overview
### `/00-basics`
    Foundations of C programming: variables, operators, and basic input/output.

### `/01-control-flow`
    Conditional statements, loops, and small programs to build logical thinking.

### `/02-functions`
    Function creation, parameters, return values, and modular code structure.

### `/03-arrays`
    One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, basic searching and sorting.

### `/04-pointers`
    Pointer fundamentals, pointer arithmetic, memory access, and applications.

### `/05-strings`
    Manual string manipulation functions similar to 42 style.

### `/06-structures`
    Introduction to struct usage and data organization.

### `/Algorithms_Logic`
    Algorithm practice organized into levels.

### `/exercism`
    Micro-exercises to strengthen fundamentals:
    - Pointers  
    - Strings  
    - Memory management

### `/mini-projects`
    Small practical C projects applying the concepts learned.

### `/templates`
    Reusable templates:
    - Makefile  
    - starter.c  
    - Project folder structure
