C Learning – Structured Roadmap
---

This repository contains my organized learning path for the C programming language.
Each main folder focuses on a specific core area of C, with examples, exercises, and small applied projects.

📁 Structure Overview
### `/00-basics`
Foundations of C programming: variables, operators, and basic input/output.

### `/01-control-flow`
Conditional statements, loops, and small programs to build logical thinking.

### `/02-functions`
Function creation, parameters, return values, and modular code structure.

### `/03-arrays`
One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, basic searching and sorting.

### `/04-pointers`
Pointer fundamentals, pointer arithmetic, memory access, and applications.

### `/05-strings`
Manual string manipulation functions similar to 42 style.

### `/06-structures`
Introduction to struct usage and data organization.

### `/projects`
Small practical C projects applying the concepts learned.

### `/algorithms`
Algorithm practice organized into levels (Level-0, Level-1, Level-2…).

### `/exercises`
Daily micro-exercises to strengthen fundamentals:
- Pointers  
- Strings  
- Memory management  

### `/templates`
Reusable templates:
- Makefile  
- starter.c  
- Project folder structure
